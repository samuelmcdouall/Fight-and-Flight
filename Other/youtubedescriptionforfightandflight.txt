This is a development diary of me creating a VR game called Fight and Flight. The basic premise is the player must fly from platform to platform, collect pickups and shoot enemies. The game is run on an HTC Vive.

This game was made for one of my courses whilst studying Games Development (Programming) MSc at Kingston University.

In this video I show off the volume controls for sfx and music. Shooting the plus or minus blocks increases or decreases the volume of the respective sound category. This continues on into the main game itself, not just the menu.

As I'm not a game designer and am just a programmer (which is what the course was focusing on), I have used a lot of assets which are mentioned below.
